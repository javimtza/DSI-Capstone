## Problem Statement
---

For this project, I will be using Neural Network to create a model that preditcs the best chess moves during a chess match. The model will be trained on games played by grandmasters as well as high elo players. The data will be retrieved from https://chess-research-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ as well as https://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html . These files come in a .pgn format (Portable Game Notation) that includes information such as Event, Site, Date, Round, Black & White players, Elom Results and Chess Moves (along with other data). At the moment, it is hard to say whether the project is too agressive. I believe that this will become clearer as we work through the Neural Networks week.
